# voice-chat-agent


A customer reports a faulty device by **voice call** to an agent named Riya. Anything awkward to say aloud (serial number, invoice, email) arrives as a **card in the chat** on the same page while the call continues. If the call drops, the chat carries on from the same state. Every session ends in **one validated, versioned JSON record**, delivered to a webhook exactly once in effect.

**Live demo:** https://device-repair-agent.onrender.com/
*(Free hosting sleeps when idle: the first load can take about a minute. Use made-up data only.)*

## How it works

```
Browser (React) ──WS /call  mic audio in, agent audio + transcript out
                └─WS /chat  cards, messages, final record
        │
Server (Python 3.13, FastAPI + uvicorn, one process)
  Call engine:  speech-to-text → LLM with tools → text-to-speech
  Command processor: every change is one transaction → append-only events → publish
  Record builder + outcome rules · Delivery outbox · Persisted timers
        │
Postgres (Neon): sessions, events, field candidates, files, records, outbox
Providers: Deepgram (STT, TTS) · Groq gpt-oss-20b (LLM) · Gemini (fallback)
```

- **One session, two views.** The call and the chat are two sockets onto the same session; each change is a database transaction that both channels see. A reload, a second tab or a server restart shows the same conversation.
- **Values are candidates.** Each answer from the call or a card is stored as a candidate; the effective field and any conflict are computed from them, so the channels cannot drift apart.
- **One record per session.** Rules turn the candidates into `completed`, `partial`, `optedOut` or `needsReview`; a record is stored and queued for delivery in one transaction, so a crash never produces it twice.

## Technical decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Own speech-to-text → LLM → text-to-speech pipeline on the server | Full control of interruption (barge-in) and transcript truncation; no provider key ever reaches the browser |
| Identifiers (serial number, email) must be typed in the chat | Speech recognition is unreliable for alphanumerics; a spoken value is kept as `unverified` |
| Completion needs an explicit "Submit claim?" tap | A misheard "yes" cannot submit a claim |
| Dates like "last Tuesday" are resolved in code, not by the model | Models get date arithmetic wrong; the resolver is tested |
| A value is saved only if the customer's own words back it | The small free-tier model invented values in early calls; saves are checked against what was actually said |
| Postgres for everything (state, files, timers, delivery outbox) | One store to restore after a restart; nothing is lost |
| Free tiers only (Render, Neon, Deepgram, Groq) | Real spend is $0; cost per session is reported as a list-price equivalent |

## Run it locally

Needs Python 3.13 with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 22 (only to build the UI) and a Postgres database (a free Neon one works).

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env     # set DATABASE_URL, PUBLIC_ORIGIN, FILE_URL_SECRET, HOOK_SECRET,
                         # and DEEPGRAM_API_KEY + GROQ_API_KEY for voice
npm ci && npm run build -w web
set -a; . ./.env; set +a
uv run python -m app     # http://localhost:8080, migrations run at start
```

Without provider keys the chat, cards, records and API still work; only calls are refused. Tests (over 1,100, on a throwaway Postgres 18, started automatically if installed locally or via `TEST_DATABASE_URL`): `uv run pytest tests`; lint and types: `uv run ruff check app tests && uv run mypy app`; UI tests: `npm test`. Deployment is a Render Blueprint (`render.yaml`, Docker) that deploys only after CI passes.

## Known limitations

- **No "which value is correct?" card** when the call and the chat disagree on an identifier; it goes to review instead.
- **English only**; no Hindi or other Indian languages yet.
- **One call at a time** (free-tier LLM rate limit), and the free server sleeps when idle, so a first call after a quiet period can start slowly.
- **A restart ends a live call**; the customer taps Call again and it resumes from the saved state.
- **No browser end-to-end tests** after the move to Python: the old Playwright specs scripted the TypeScript server's fakes in-process and were dropped. The API, both sockets and a real server process are covered by the Python tests.
- **Model behaviour is the least-tested part**: tool handling and guards are tested with scripted models, but what the real model says is only checked by hand.
- **Cost and latency numbers are not yet measured** on the deployed system ([how they will be](docs/performance.md)).

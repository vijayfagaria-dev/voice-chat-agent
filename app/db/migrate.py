"""Versioned SQL migrations, applied at boot.

Each migration runs in its own transaction, guarded by a transaction-scoped advisory lock. Session-level locks do not
work through Neon's transaction-mode pooler; `pg_advisory_xact_lock` does. Two instances booting at once therefore
apply each migration exactly once: the second waits, then sees it recorded and skips it.

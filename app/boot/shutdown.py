"""Graceful shutdown (P8-T02). Every deploy restarts the server, so a clean stop must not leave a call half-open or lose
a write. Order, all inside one hard limit (default 10 s, Render's documented default grace is 30 s):

 1. stop accepting and close the sockets: /call and /chat get 1012 "server restarting" (ws.plugin)
 2. let every call finish ending: its EndCall must commit before the pool closes (settle_calls)
 3. stop the sweeper (the only background source of commands), then drain the commands still in flight
 4. stop the outbox worker (an unfinished delivery keeps its lease and is redelivered after a restart)
 5. end the database pool last

A step that fails or times out is logged and the next one still runs; only the hard limit forces exit code 1.

"""Startup recovery (P8-T01) against a seeded, inconsistent database: an open call, a stale call pointer, a call row nobody
points at, an outbox lease a dead process held, an overdue timer, a card that never opened, and orphaned uploads. After one
recovery everything is consistent, each fix is counted in the log, and a second run does nothing.
